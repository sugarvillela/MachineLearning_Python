# MachineLearning_Python
* Written during an introductory ML course using Python and Numpy
* This repos is not organized; just a bunch of code I wrote in a hurry

## BayesNaiveClassifier.py 
* Contains first project:
* Duplicates an implementation in JavaScript in my Statistics repo: https://github.com/sugarvillela/Statistics 

## regression.py 
* Contains early projects:
* Perceptron
* Gradient Descent (sochastic, batch, with and without regularization)
* Cross-Validation with different values of lambda

## endOfQuarter.py 
* Contains later projects:
* Gradient Descent redux
* Neural Net
* Utilities
* Clustering (very slow)
